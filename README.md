# Mycelium
## Installation
First, install the mycelium following:
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v10.x.x recommended)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)

Second, start mongodb locally by running the `mongod` executable in your mongodb installation (you may need to create a `data` directory or set `--dbpath`).

Then, run `npm install` and `npm start` from the project root to start . Finally, navigate to `http://localhost:8888` to start using mycelium!

**Note**- When creating a new project, select the option to create it from a seed and select "SemanticGraph."
